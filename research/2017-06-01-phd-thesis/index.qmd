## Abstract
The rise of neuroimaging in the last years has provided physicians and radiologist with the ability to study the brain with unprecedented ease. This led to a new biological perspective in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, allowing the characterization of different anatomical and functional patterns associated with them. **Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD)** systems use statistical techniques for preparing, processing and extracting information from neuroimaging data pursuing a major goal: **optimize the process of analysis and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and mental conditions**.

With this thesis we focus on three different stages of the CAD pipeline: preprocessing, feature extraction and validation. For **preprocessing**, we have developed a method that target a relatively recent concern: the confounding effect of false positives due to differences in the acquisition at multiple sites. Our method can effectively merge datasets while reducing the acquisition site effects. Regarding **feature extraction**, we have studied decomposition algorithms (independent component analysis, factor analysis), texture features and a complete framework called Spherical Brain Mapping, that reduces the 3-dimensional brain images to two-dimensional statistical maps. This allowed us to improve the performance of automatic systems for detecting Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Finally, we developed a **brain image simulation technique** that can be used to validate new functional datasets as well as for educational purposes.
