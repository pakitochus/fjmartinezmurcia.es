    "text": "Significance Weighted Principal Component Analysis (SWPCA) is a technique developed to parse out the influence of a categorical variable that introduces variability in a certain dataset (Martinez-Murcia et al. 2017). This was originally intended to remove acquisition site variance in neuroimaging databases.\nDownload the code:  Download\n\nUse\nTo use the script to remove, navigate to the download dir, load the library (import swpca) into your environment and execute this command using the current dataset and acquisition site variables:\nimport swpca\ndataset_rect,weights,A =swpca.swpca(dataset, site)\nIt will return the rectified dataset, to be used in subsequent analysis.\n\n\nAlgorithm Pipeline and Context\nThe main use of the SWPCA algorithm is within the context of common neuroimaging analysis, such as Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) or a classification analysis. It is a preprocessing step, and as such, it is used just after any other preprocessing steps (such as normalization, etc), and before any further analysis. It provides rectified maps with the influence of the categorical variables removed, therefore decreasing the occurrence of false positives.\n\n\n\nSchema of the SWPCA pipeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMartinez-Murcia, Francisco Jesús, Meng-Chuan Lai, Juan Manuel Gorriz, Javier Ramirez, Adam MH Young, Sean CL Deoni, Christine Ecker, et al. 2017. “On the Brain Structure Heterogeneity of Autism: Parsing Out Acquisition Site Effects with Significance-Weighted Principal Component Analysis.” Human Brain Mapping 38 (3): 1208–23.\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{martinez-murcia2016,\n  author = {Martinez-Murcia, F.J.},\n  title = {Significance {Weighted} {Principal} {Component} {Analysis}\n    {(SWPCA)}},\n  date = {2016-10-24},\n  url = {https://pakitochus.github.io/fjmartinezmurcia.es/posts/2016-09-15-project-sbm/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMartinez-Murcia, F.J. 2016. “Significance Weighted Principal\nComponent Analysis (SWPCA).” October 24, 2016. https://pakitochus.github.io/fjmartinezmurcia.es/posts/2016-09-15-project-sbm/."
