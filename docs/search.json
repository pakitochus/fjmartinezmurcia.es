    "text": "Schema of Brain Simulator\n\n\nbrainSimulator is a brain image synthesis procedure for data augmentation and standardization of evaluation of ML neuroimaging pipelines. It intends to generate a new image set that share characteristics given an original one. The system focuses on nuclear imaging modalities such as PET or SPECT brain images. It analyses the dataset by applying PCA to the original dataset, and then model the distribution of samples in the projected eigenbrain space using a Probability Density Function (PDF) estimator. Once the model has been built, anyone can generate new coordinates on the eigenbrain space belonging to the same class, which can be then projected back to the image space.\n Documentation  Download\n\nInstallation\nbrainSimulator is now available via pypi and can be installed directly from:\npip install brainSimulator\nAlternatively, download the package, uncompress and execute:\ncd /path/to/uncompressed/brainSimulator/\npython setup.py install\n\n\nQuickstart\nThis allows to train the model once and then perform as many sample drawings as required.\n#navigate to the folder where simulator.py is located\nimport brainSimulator as sim\n\nsimulator = sim.BrainSimulator(algorithm='PCA', method='mvnormal')\nsimulator.fit(original_dataset, labels) \nimages, classes = simulator.generateDataset(original_dataset, labels, N=200, classes=[0, 1, 2])\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{martinez-murcia2017,\n  author = {Martinez-Murcia, F.J.},\n  title = {BrainSimulator},\n  date = {2017-11-30},\n  url = {https://pakitochus.github.io/fjmartinezmurcia.es/posts/2017-11-30-project-brainsimulator/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMartinez-Murcia, F.J. 2017. “BrainSimulator.” November 30,\n2017. https://pakitochus.github.io/fjmartinezmurcia.es/posts/2017-11-30-project-brainsimulator/."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe rise of neuroimaging in the last years has provided physicians and radiologist with the ability to study the brain with unprecedented ease. This led to a new biological perspective in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, allowing the characterization of different anatomical and functional patterns associated with them. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems use statistical techniques for preparing, processing and extracting information from neuroimaging data pursuing a major goal: optimize the process of analysis and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and mental conditions.\nWith this thesis we focus on three different stages of the CAD pipeline: preprocessing, feature extraction and validation. For preprocessing, we have developed a method that target a relatively recent concern: the confounding effect of false positives due to differences in the acquisition at multiple sites. Our method can effectively merge datasets while reducing the acquisition site effects. Regarding feature extraction, we have studied decomposition algorithms (independent component analysis, factor analysis), texture features and a complete framework called Spherical Brain Mapping, that reduces the 3-dimensional brain images to two-dimensional statistical maps. This allowed us to improve the performance of automatic systems for detecting Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Finally, we developed a brain image simulation technique that can be used to validate new functional datasets as well as for educational purposes."
