    "text": "Schema of Brain Simulator\n\n\nbrainSimulator is a brain image synthesis procedure for data augmentation and standardization of evaluation of ML neuroimaging pipelines. It intends to generate a new image set that share characteristics given an original one. The system focuses on nuclear imaging modalities such as PET or SPECT brain images. It analyses the dataset by applying PCA to the original dataset, and then model the distribution of samples in the projected eigenbrain space using a Probability Density Function (PDF) estimator. Once the model has been built, anyone can generate new coordinates on the eigenbrain space belonging to the same class, which can be then projected back to the image space.\n Documentation  Download\n\nInstallation\nbrainSimulator is now available via pypi and can be installed directly from:\npip install brainSimulator\nAlternatively, download the package, uncompress and execute:\ncd /path/to/uncompressed/brainSimulator/\npython setup.py install\n\n\nQuickstart\nThis allows to train the model once and then perform as many sample drawings as required.\n#navigate to the folder where simulator.py is located\nimport brainSimulator as sim\n\nsimulator = sim.BrainSimulator(algorithm='PCA', method='mvnormal')\nsimulator.fit(original_dataset, labels) \nimages, classes = simulator.generateDataset(original_dataset, labels, N=200, classes=[0, 1, 2])\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{martinez-murcia2017,\n  author = {Martinez-Murcia, F.J.},\n  title = {BrainSimulator},\n  date = {2017-11-30},\n  url = {https://pakitochus.github.io/fjmartinezmurcia.es/posts/2017-11-30-project-brainsimulator/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMartinez-Murcia, F.J. 2017. “BrainSimulator.” November 30,\n2017. https://pakitochus.github.io/fjmartinezmurcia.es/posts/2017-11-30-project-brainsimulator/."
