Currently I research in Information Technology, inside the interdisciplinary field of Computer Aided Diagnosis, Image-based diagnosis and Statistical and Digital Signal Processing. A provisional title for all this research is Computed Aided Diagnosis for the detection of Neurodegenerative Disorders using Medical Imaging.

During this period I have belonged to the Signal Processing and Biomedical Applications (SiPBA) research group, and I have written or contributed to several publications.
